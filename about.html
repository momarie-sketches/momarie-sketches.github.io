        <p>The biggest shift in my life was when I decided to change my major in undergrad. I went from taking animal
            biology classes and volunteering at veterinary clinics to analyzing films and thinking about the way that
            digital media has changed our perception of the world. I became fascinated by the ideologies of the American
            society and critically thought about how women have been viewed and treated within these spaces.
            <br><br>With these new found interests and ideals a part of me, my goal is to express my optimism and
            imagination
            through illustrations, animations, and video games of how different the world would look if our ideology was
            not as it is now.<br><br>Link to my resume here.
